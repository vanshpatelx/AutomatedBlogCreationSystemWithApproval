# Project : Automated Blog Creation System ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This project aims to create an automated blog creation system using the Gemini Pro language model and various agents orchestrated by CrewAI. The system includes a Telegram bot for user interaction, a multi-agent setup for blog creation, integration with Notion for storing drafts, and a notification system for approval and publishing.

## How Works ?
- **User Interaction:** Users initiate the blog creation process by interacting with a Telegram bot and providing a blog name.
- **Agent Orchestration:** CrewAI orchestrates three agents for specific roles: Content Generator, Notion Publisher, and Notifier.
- **Agent Roles:**
   - **Content Generator:** Utilizes the Gemini Pro language model to create engaging blog content based on the provided blog name with four agents.
       - Senior Researcher
       - Insight Researcher
       - Tech Content Strategist
       - Markdown Formatter
   -  **Notion Publication:** The Notion Publisher Agent adds the generated content to a designated Notion workspace for draft storage.
  - **Notification for Approval:** The Notifier Agent sends a notification to the user, containing a preview link to the blog draft in Notion, indicating that the blog is ready for review.
  - **User Review and Approval:** Users receive the notification and review the blog draft in Notion.
     - Users approve the draft through the Telegram bot interface.
  - **Automated Publishing (Optional):** An optional step can be added to automate the publishing of approved content.
